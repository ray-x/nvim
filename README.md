 # NeoVim as a programming IDE

## 🏎 🏎 🏎 Need for speed! 🏎 🏎 🏎

This neovim configure file is highly optimized for the impatient. Super lazy loading + After syntax highlight rendering. Render multiple files with treesitter in less than 45ms with ~170 plugins installed
(e.g. Open both util.lua(1686 loc) and lsp.lua(1538 loc) from neovim source code in 58.6ms)
The setup set all plugins to be lazy loaded and trigger when it needed.

The `Packer` config locates in branch [Packer branch](https://github.com/ray-x/nvim/tree/packer)
It serves as my personal nvim setup. I am using it as my daily driver. The structure can be messy so it is not a setup for beginner

- nvim Telescope preview:

## Neovim Plugins

There are lots of amazing plugins,
I used following plugin a lots

- `Plug` -> `Dein` -> `Lua-Packer` -> [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

  I followed Glepnir https://github.com/glepnir/nvim dotfiles when I start this repo.
  A.T.M. nvim-cmp as a completion engine with LSP, LSP saga. vim-multi-cursor, telescope. treesitter,
  lazy load vim-go. So, other than module folder, I could copy/paste everything else from glepnir's configure file,
  which make my life easier.

- Telescope + fzf

  One of the best plugin for search anything. I used it to replace fzf, leaderF, leaderP, defx, Ag/Ack/Rg, yank(ring), project management. undolist and many more. Telescope is awesome, only issue is performance.

- nvim-lsp with [navigator.lua](https://github.com/ray-x/navigator.lua)

  vim-go and coc add around 200ms time and some of the extensions
  might crash when I using (but it hard to check which because ~4 node.js services coc forked)
  Some useful script from TJ, and [glepnir](https://github.com/glepnir)

  nvim-tree: file-explorer (lightweight and fast)
  hrsh7th/nvim-cmp: auto-complete
  vsnip + luasnips: code snipts(Load snippet from VSCode extension). It is a full featured IDE.

## Install

Note: I tested it on Mac and linux, not sure about window

Clone the repo

Link nvim to $HOME/.config/

e.g.

```
ls ~/.config/nvim

~/.config/nvim -> /Users/rayx/github/dotfiles/nvim

```

On windows the config path is
`C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Local\nvim`
You need to link or replace above folder

Please install Nerd Fonts(I am using VictorMono) and kitty so font setting in GUI will work as expected

Startup nvim

If you saw error message "Error in packer_compiled: ..." Please press `Enter`, that will allow packer install the plugins.
After all plugins install restart the nvim.

Note:
The packages and data will be install to
`~/.local/share/nvim`

Please backup this folder if necessary

The setup needs nvim0.8+. For earlier release, please check packer branch. A patched nerd font is needed. Also if you start nvim from terminal,
make sure it support nerdfont and emoji

### missing sqlite, libsqlite3

Some of the plugin I am using depends on sqlite.
By default sqlite was installed on MacOS. For other operating system, if you saw error message about sqlite, please
following the instruction [here to install sqlite](https://github.com/kkharji/sqlite.lua#windows)

You can put your own plugins setup in `modules/user` folder

## Shell
